Welcome to our next post! :-) Today's topic is a very prominent code editor:
**Visual Studio Code** (VS Code). According to _Wakatime_, VS Code was by far
the most used code editor in 2022 (see the chart below). And that's for a
reason! VS Code offers a rich feature set at a high degree of customization. By
the way, this post is written using VS Code ;-) First, we want to discuss
different kinds of editors. Then, we show you how to install VS code
step-by-step. As a benefit, we provide you our custom settings.

## Editors & IDEs

Nowadays, simple editors that only offer text editing are super rare. Even tiny
editors have features like **syntax highlighting** and **autocompletion**.
Syntax highlighting highlights keywords of a programming language. Soon, you
will notice that it is much easier to read colorized than simple black-and-white
code. Autocompletion is a handy feature: Imagine you define a variable and want
to use it later. Once you start typing the first letters of the variable, it is
automatically completed. That saves a lot of typing.

In general, there are two types of editors. _Terminal_ editors like Vim or Nano
are the first type. As you might guess from the name, they run directly in the
terminal. Their advantage is that they are very lightweight and run even on less
powerful processors. Also, they don’t use GUI elements, which can be beneficial
if you want to edit files remotely on a machine without a graphical interface
(like a server). One downside of terminal editors is that they are typically not
convenient to use as a beginner.

Besides terminal editors, there are _graphical_ editors for a more intimate user
experience, which are often called **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment).
IDEs offer everything you need for development, such as **build automation** and
a graphical **debugger**. We will demonstrate this in upcoming posts. Since
editors became very powerful over the past years, the distinction between an
editor and an IDE is often unclear.

Some IDEs are specific to one programming language. For example, in the chart at
the beginning of this post, you can find PyCharm, which was developed for
Python. Over time, IDEs that target multiple (or nearly all) purposes, such as
Atom or VS code, became very popular. Usually, they come as a very basic IDE,
and _extensions_ allow the user to tailor the editor to suit their needs. We
will install extensions for VS code later in this post. In addition to
extensions, nearly all editors offer a high degree of customization. You can
change colors, add shortcuts, and much more. We will provide you with our own
customizations as a starting point. But most likely, you will find your own
customizations over time.

What else can you expect from a good IDE? **Indexing** is very useful for larger
code bases. Imagine your code has more than a thousand lines divided over
multiple files (which is not unrealistic!). You want to see the definition of a
used function. One way would be to search all files for the function, but if the
function is used multiple times across different files, searching is not a very
convenient way to find the function definition. This is where indexing comes in.
Because the IDE indexed all code, it knows where the function definition is and
can directly open it for you. So, indexing can be described as generating an
address book of all variables, functions, types, and so on. Another cool feature
is **Linting**. Linting checks your code while you type. It can detect errors
like a typo in a variable right away. Don't worry if you don't have a picture of
these features yet. It will become clear once you start coding.

Now, let's get started and install VS Code!

## Installing VS code

In previous posts, we demonstrated how to install programs using Pacman. Here,
we want to use something else called _Snap_. Feel free to read this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)"> Wikipedia</a> article
to learn more about it. Why don't we use Pacman? Simply because Pacman doesn't
provide VS code. If you want to get installation instructions, it’s often a good
idea to visit the program’s homepage.

First, we use Pacman to install Snap:

    sudo pacman -S snapd

Snap is a system service that runs in the background. We have to enable it:

    sudo systemctl enable snapd
    sudo systemctl start snapd

Finally, we need to create a link:

    sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap

Sounds all like black magic to you? Well, often it does for us as well :-D Let's
keep things simple here: If you want to install something, you will find
instructions with the help of Google.

Before we can install VS code, we have to reboot the computer. This ensures that
everything is set up correctly for Snap to work. Install VS code:

    sudo snap install code --classic

That's it!

## Starting VS code for the first time

You can run VS code either from the application menu in Manjaro or from the
terminal:

    code &

Once VS code is started, you see a _Welcome_ screen, from where you can directly
create files and start coding. But let's deal with some settings first. On the
left bar, you can see several icons. If you hover over them with your mouse, you
get some explanation.

Let's start with the fifth icon from the top, which is labeled **Extensions**.
Once you click on the icon, you can look for extensions on the marketplace. Good
extensions can improve your coding experience a lot. So, it is wise to spend
some time to find the extensions that meet your needs. But since it is hard to
know your needs as a beginner, we prepared you a list of our favorite
extensions. Before we show you how to install them, click on the gear wheel icon
at the bottom and select **Settings**. Here, you can customize almost
everything: Colors, cursor styles, auto-saving, and much more. When you have
time, it’s worth checking out what is possible. But since we want to get coding
fast, we will share our settings with you.

VS code supports so-called **Profiles**. Profiles store extensions and settings.
It's possible to have multiple profiles to target different projects. For
example, you might have one profile for Python and another one for web
programming. It is also possible to export/import profiles, so it's super easy
to share settings with friends and colleagues. From our
[_Getting Started_](https://github.com/bitsandvolts/getting_started/blob/master/config_files/vs_code/bitsandvolts.code-profile)
repository, you can download our default profile. Click on the gear wheel icon
and select _Profiles -> Import Profile_, as shown in the image below. Select the
file you downloaded from our repo and import everything. It will take a moment
to download all extensions. Note that we might update our profile from time to
time.

Once everything is installed, you can find new icons added by extensions. If you
are interested, you can again click on the extensions icon. Now, you can find a
list of installed extensions. You can click on each extension to read what they
are for. We will explain further features of VS code when we use them in our
upcoming programming posts.

## Summary

We hope you were able to install VS code :-) Let's summarize a few things:

- There are terminal editors and IDEs
- Some IDEs are specific to one programming language
- Some IDEs can be used for multiple languages
- Extensions add further functionality to VS code
- VS code supports profiles to switch between different settings
- We introduced several IDE features: Syntax highlighting, autocompletion,
  indexing, and linting

In our next post, we will start with our first programming language: Python :-)
