Last time, we learned the basics of
[transistors](/categories/digital_design/transistors). Now, it's time to learn
about **logic gates**. Logic gates can be built using transistors and are the
fundamental building blocks of any complex digital circuit. In this post, we
will cover how logic gates work in principle. In a future post, we will then see
how logic gates can be built using transistors.

Let's get started!

## Logic Operations and Truth Tables

As the name suggests, logic gates perform so-called **logic operations**. A
logical operation takes some inputs and combines them in a specific way to
produce an output. Each input can be either "true" or "false" (or "1", or "0").
The same holds for the output. For example, the logical "**AND**" operation has
two inputs, let's call them A and B, and one output, that we name Z. The output
Z will only be "true" when both A _and_ B are "true"; hence "and".

The behavior of any logical operation can be represented using a special table,
called the **truth table**. The truth table shows for all possible input
combinations the corresponding output values, thereby fully characterizing the
function of the particular logic operation. For example, the truth table of the
AND operation looks like this:

| A   | B   | Z = A _and_ B |
| --- | --- | :-----------: |
| 0   | 0   |       0       |
| 0   | 1   |       0       |
| 1   | 0   |       0       |
| 1   | 1   |       1       |

As you can see in the last row, the output Z is only "on" (1) when _both_
inputs, A and B, are "on"; otherwise, the output stays "off" (0). Let's look at
the truth table of another logic operation, the **OR**:

| A   | B   | Z = A _or_ B |
| --- | --- | :----------: |
| 0   | 0   |      0       |
| 0   | 1   |      1       |
| 1   | 0   |      1       |
| 1   | 1   |      1       |

Can you see the difference of the OR compared to the AND operation? The OR
operation produces a "1" at its output when _at least_ one input is set to "1".
This behavior is also what its name suggests: A _or_ B (and that also includes
the case when both A and B are 1). Another interesting logic operation is the
**NOT** operation:

| A   | Z = _not_ A |
| --- | :---------: |
| 0   |      1      |
| 1   |      0      |

The NOT operation only has one input and one output. Again, as the name
suggests, the NOT operation simply produces the _inverse_ (or the _negation_) of
its input.

Now, buckle up! Your mind is about to be blown away: With only the three logic
operations we presented you above, namely the AND, OR, and the NOT operations,
it is possible to construct ANY digital circuit, even the processor you are
using to read this blog post[^1]!

Next, we will learn how this is done in practice.

[^1]:
    For the people that are already screaming: Yes, you need a bit more than
    just logic operations to build a processor, but for the digital part of the
    chip, the statement is true.

## Basic Logic Gates

Logic operations are implemented in hardware using **logic gates**. Just like a
logic operation, a logic gate has inputs and output(s). For example, this is the
logic gate for the AND operation, or short, **AND gate**:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-and-gate.jpg" alt="AND gate" title="AND gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

To be fair, this is not how the AND gate looks on the final chip, in reality,
but this is how we represent an AND gate when drawing logic circuit
diagrams[^2]. As we mentioned initially, we will see in one of the next post how
logic gates are really implemented in hardware. For now, it is sufficient to
view logic gates as **black boxes** that take inputs, perform logical
operations, such as AND, on the inputs and produce an output.

[^2]:
    There are also other ways to draw logic gate symbols. The logic gates we
    showed you here, are part of the ANSI standard. Other standards are IEC, or
    DIN. In our blog series, we will continue to use the ANSI gates.

<div class='note-normal'>
When we consider some object (like a logic gate) as a <b>black box</b>, we only care about its behavior visible to the <i>outside</i>. We don't care how the object works on the inside. To give you a real-life example: think of a car. Whenever you get in your car, turn it on, and start driving, do you think every time of how its engine works? Of course not (unless you are a mechanical engineer, maybe)! Most of us view their cars as <i>black boxes</i>: we give it <i>inputs</i> (gas, brakes, steering), and based on these inputs, the car performs some action (accelerating, deaccelerating, turning), the <i>output</i>, so to say.
</div>

<div class='note-normal'>
As we told you in our last post about transistors, in circuits, binary values
are represented using voltage and/or current. So, the input to the logic gates
is some form of voltage/current, and the same holds for its output. A logical
"1" ("true") is usually represented with a "high" voltage (e.g. 5 Volts), and
"0" ("false") is represented with a "low" voltage (e.g. 0 Volts).
</div>

In the following, we show you some other gates that implement the logic
operations we introduced above.

This is the symbol of the **OR gate**:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-or-gate.jpg" alt="OR gate" title="OR gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

And this is the **NOT gate**:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-not-gate.jpg" alt="NOT gate" title="NOT gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

These were the most basic gates. Next, let's have a look at some more complex
gates!

## Complex Logic Gates and Circuits

As the output of a logic gate is also a binary value (0 or 1), nobody hinders us
to connect multiple logic gates together to perform more complex operations! For
instance, can you figure out the truth table of the following circuit:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-and-not-gate.jpg" alt="AND-NOT gate" title="AND-NOT gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Here is the solution:

| A   | B   | Z   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

If you got it right, pat yourself on your shoulder! If not, that's totally fine,
we will explain to you now how it works: this "combined gate" has two inputs, A
and B. We have to look at all possible input value combinations (there are four
of them). These inputs first go into the AND gate, and its truth table we
already know:

| A   | B   | "A and B" |
| --- | --- | :-------: |
| 0   | 0   |     0     |
| 0   | 1   |     0     |
| 1   | 0   |     0     |
| 1   | 1   |     1     |

Now comes the crucial part. The _output_ of the AND gate is at the same time the
_input_ of the NOT gate! Therefore, to determine the output of the NOT gate, and
hence the overall output, Z, we consult the truth table of the NOT gate and use
the values in the "A and B" column as its input:

| A   | B   | "A and B" | Z   |
| --- | --- | :-------: | --- |
| 0   | 0   |     0     | 1   |
| 0   | 1   |     0     | 1   |
| 1   | 0   |     0     | 1   |
| 1   | 1   |     1     | 0   |

Remember, when the input is 0, the NOT produces a 1, and vice versa. There we
go, we constructed our first truth table!

This combination of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate is quite common in
digital circuits, therefore they have been merged into one single gate, called
the **NAND** gate. Its symbol looks like this:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-nand-gate.jpg" alt="NAND gate" title="NAND gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Basically, we just took the circle from the NOT gate and stuck it at the output
of the AND gate to indicate that the output is negated. We can do the same with
any other logic gate, such as the OR gate:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-nor-gate.jpg" alt="NOT gate" title="NOT gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

This gate is similarly called **NOR** gate. As an exercise, try to write down
the truth table of a NOR gate!

Let's look at some more examples. Again, first, try to figure out the truth
table of the following circuit by yourself:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-or2-gate.jpg" alt="NAND with inverted inputs" title="NAND with inverted inputs">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Got it? Here is what you should have gotten:

| A   | B   | Z   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

Do you remember this truth table? Right, this is an OR gate! This means, that we
can construct an OR gate from two NOT gates and one NAND gate. By the way: When
some inputs of a gate are _inverted_, like in the example above, we don't have
to draw the full NOT gates. Similar to how we draw a small circle at the output
of the NAND gate, we can also draw circles at inputs to indicate that these are
inverted. For instance, here is the simplified version of the example above:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-or3-gate.jpg" alt="NAND with inverted inputs" title="NAND with inverted inputs">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

<!--
Ealier we said that you only need AND, OR and NOT gates to build any digital circuit. Well, now we can refine that statement: you only need AND and NOT gates! However, this is just relevant in logic theory

And it goes even further. Look at the following circuit:

todo: Picture where same input to NAND (= NOT)

This just a NAND gate where both inputs are connected with each other. This means that both inputs will always have the same value. The truth table of this special NAND gate is just the table of the normal NAND, but without the rows where the inputs are different:

| A | B | Z |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

As both inputs are always the same, we can view this NAND gate also as a single input gate; let's just call its input "A". The truth table remains unchanged (just column B disappeared):

| A | Z |
|---|---|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |

Wait, that looks exactly like the TT of the NOT gate!
-->

Here's another more complex circuit. Try to work out its truth table:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-xor1-gate.jpg" alt="XOR complex" title="XOR complex">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

_Hint_: When two wires cross without touching each other in a circuit diagram,
we draw a little arc. In the circuit above, you can see an example at the upper
AND gate, where the wire A crosses wire B without touching.

This is the truth table of the circuit:

| A   | B   | Z   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

Do you notice a pattern in this truth table? The output is only "on" when
exactly _one_ input is turned on. And in fact, this behavior turns out to be so
important in digital circuits, that there is even a dedicated logic gate for it:
the **XOR** gate (XOR stands for "exclusive OR"). The XOR gate has the following
symbol:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-xor-gate.jpg" alt="XOR gate" title="XOR gate">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

And, with this, we have covered most of the basic logic gates! For those of you
who like a little challenge, we have prepared the following circuit:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:90%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-excercise.jpg" alt="Excercise" title="Excercise">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Can you figure out its truth table? We have already prepared it for you:

| A   | B   | C   | Z   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | ?   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | ?   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | ?   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | ?   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | ?   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | ?   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | ?   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | ?   |

We will present you the solution in our next post, so don't miss that!
