Welcome to our first post on **Digital Design**! We are glad that you found your
way into this very exciting topic. In this post, we will try to give you an
overview of the various aspects of digital design. For each topic, we will of
course make a detailed and comprehensive post. This series intends to share our
knowledge and experience in designing digital systems, such as microprocessors,
with you. Unlike many other resources, we will start from the ground up and
explain the basic principles behind many of the technologies in digital design
in a simple way. So, if you've never heard of digital design before, this is the
right place to start! And, if you are already an experienced student or
engineer, you are also welcome, of course; maybe you might learn something new
along the way. We also invite you (newbies + experienced) to give us feedback
and ideas for future posts!

Now, let's jump in, shall we?

If you look around you, you will probably find at least one _electronic_ device
near you. In fact, you are probably reading this post through one of those
devices. Have you ever wondered, how such small devices which surround us every
day, can do so much powerful things? For most people, their devices are just
made up of "black magic", and they "just work". But if you have made it until
this point, you are probably interested in _what_ that "black magic" actually
_is_, right? Then keep on reading and we will shed some light on this complex,
but fascinating topic!

## Microchips

All of our intelligent devices are powered by what are called **microchips**.
You probably have heard that term before. A microchip (or just, _chip_) is a
very tiny **electronic circuit** that can be integrated into other systems, to
do some useful tasks for that system. There are a variety of chips designed
specifically for certain tasks. For example:

- Measuring some state (e.g, temperature) of the system
- Controlling the system
- Processing data aquired by the system
- ...

Maybe you have seen these black squares and rectangles that can be found all
over circuit boards (such as the one shown below). These are all microchips!

</figure>
Usually, a complex technical system consolidates multiple (10s to 100s) of
different chips. Just look at a modern car: Nowadays, you can also think of a
car as a supercomputer on four wheels. In a car, there are hundreds of different
chips built into it. For example, there are chips that control the correct
operation of the engine, others control the air conditioning and still others
take care of the infotainment system. And things don't stop here: with emerging
technologies, such as autonomous driving, future cars will require even more,
and more powerful chips.

Another example is your smartphone (which you might be holding in your hand
right now). It also has several chips built into this what seems tiny space. It
can be hard to imagine that modern smartphones are waaay more powerful than
_room-sized_ computers in the 60s or 70s (why this is the case we will see in a
bit). Like in a car, there are also different chips for different tasks inside a
smartphone. First of all, you have the CPU (central processing unit), which is
like the brain of your smartphone. It essentially controls everything else to
follow. You have specialized chips for doing network and radio processing to
handle phone calls and mobile data, image processors to enhance the quality of
the photos you take, controllers that regulate the charging of your phone, and
many more...

Not only in our smartphones and cars we can find chips but also in areas such as

- Personal computing (PC, laptops, smartphones)
- Entertainment (TVs, radios, gaming consoles, ...)
- Health care
- Industry/manufacturing
- Planes
- Rockets
- Mars rovers (yes, we even have chips on _other planets_!)
- ...

We can probably continue that list endlessly. But you get the point: It's hard
to imagine modern society without microchips!

Ok, now you should have a broad understanding of what a microchip is and why
they are so important nowadays. So your next question probably is: How are they
made? This is where Digital Design comes into play. Digital design is a branch
of electrical and computer engineering that focuses on the design of, well, you
guessed it, microchips. Therefore, we also call it "Chip Design". But before we
dive into the design of chips, we first need to understand what a chip is
actually made of.

## Transistors

Let's start from the foundations. A chip is nothing but a tiny electrical
circuit. The fundamental building block that only made microchips possible is
the **transistor**. Maybe you have heard about them before (processor marketing
likes to include statements like "_Our new processor has XY billion
transistors!_"). A transistor is nothing but a _switch_. However, unlike a
_mechanical_ switch, a transistor's switching behavior can be controlled by some
other _current_ (or voltage). This allows the transistor to be much faster and
smaller.
</div>

The first transistor was invented way back in 1947(!) and could be held in one
hand. Since then the sizes of transistors have been shrinking - and they still
do today. Modern chips contain _billions_ of transistors. When you hear terms
like "5nm CPU", that means nothing but the size of one transistor on that chip
(actually that is not entirely true, but that's another story). So, transistors
nowadays are only in the range of one _billionth_ of a meter in size - just
imagine: this means that modern transistors are over 10,000x smaller than a
human hair! You might have heard about "Moore's Law" before. The "law" was named
after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, he predicted that the number of
transistors in chips would double about every two years. And in fact, this
_exponential_ trend kept continuing for several decades, thanks to the
advancements in transistor technology.

  <!-- <figcaption class="text-center"></figcaption> -->
</figure>
But what makes transistors so special for chips? As we said earlier, a
transistor behaves like a switch. You probably know that any switch (eg, a light
switch) can be either "on" or "off", either "closed" or "open", either "1" or
"0". (Maybe, in some reader's heads, some bells started ringing, but if not that
is totally fine, too - that's why we created Bits&Volts :) This means a
transistor can be in two _states_ (on-off, 1-0). And this is also precisely the
reason why computers "think" in 1s and 0s, or _binary_. However, one transistor
on its own cannot do much useful work for us. We have to connect multiple such
transistors to form more complex circuits, that then can perform the tasks we
designed them for. But how do these circuits look like? These circuits are
composed of so-called **logic gates**, which we will cover next.

## Logic Gates

<div style="overflow: auto;" markdown="1">
<figure class="img-right">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00001-logic-gates.svg" alt="Logic Gates" title="Logic Gates">
  <figcaption class="text-center">Logic Gates.</figcaption>
</figure>
A logic gate is made up of a couple of transistors and has inputs and outputs.
Each input can be either a "1" or "0". A logic gate now produces a value at its
outputs (for each output, either 1 or 0) based on what values are present at its
inputs. There are different kind of logic gates. The most basic ones are AND,
OR, and NOT gates. For instance, an AND gate has two inputs and one output. It
produces a "1" at its output only when both of its inputs are set to "1". Using
the basic gates we can also construct other gates, such as XOR gates. We will
cover logic gates in more detail in a later post, so don't worry if you didn't
fully understand what's going on.
</div>

The idea now is, to connect multiple of such logic gates to perform more complex
_logical operations_. It turns out that we can describe most of the well-known
mathematical functions and operations using logical operations. These logical
operations have their foundation in the theory of **Boolean Algebra**. That now
means, we can design logic circuits that can _compute_ stuff. Well, there you
have it: the processor inside a _computer_ is nothing but that!

Now let's see how we design such logic circuits.

## EDA, HDLs and Testing

In the early days of microchips, the logic gate circuits were designed mostly by
hand. This was kind of doable, because the number of transistors compared to
today was much smaller, usually between 100s - 1000s. However, as the
transistors were getting smaller and the chips more complex, engineers realized
that designing those chips by hand would take a lot of time and was prone to
errors. This was when the era of **Electronic Design Automation** (EDA) began.
Engineers would now design their chips using so-called **Hardware Description
Languages** (HDLs). These HDLs were inspired by programming languages used for
writing software (however, writing software and writing digital hardware are two
entirely different things!). The HDL code of the design is then _translated_
into an equivalent logic gates description of the circuit by an _EDA software
tool_. Again, this has some similarities with modern software design, where a
_compiler_ translates the higher-level code into assembly language for the CPU.

With the use of HDLs, the engineers didn't need to focus on each and every
transistor anymore and could put more time and effort into the actual design of
their system. Two HDLs emerged in the 1980s: VHDL and Verilog. These are still
the main languages to use when it comes to digital design. In the last couple of
decades, new trends in digital design emerged, among which the most popular was
**High-Level Synthesis** (HLS). The idea of HLS is to take an algorithm written
in some high-level programming language, such as C, and automatically generate
an optimized digital circuit for that particular algorithm. To this date,
researchers all over the world are trying to come up with new languages and
design paradigms with the hope of eventually replacing the traditional HDLs.

The rapid advancement of microchips over the past decades was - apart from the
technological improvements in transistors - made possible by EDA. EDA tools
automate many time-consuming tasks in chip design. Two of the most important
tasks are _Synthesis_ and _Place & Route_. In Synthesis, the HDL code is
translated into a logic gates circuit (not a physical one, but described in some
file). Then, in Place & Route, the EDA tool tries to find the optimal location
for each gate on the final chip. Both tasks try to follow certain _constraints_
given by the engineer, such as the final performance or power consumption of the
chip. The tools use physical models of the actual gates to come up with
estimations on performance or power consumption. The engineer can then analyze
the results, and refine his design if he is not satisfied. We will show you how
that's done in practice in a later post in this series.

Another important aspect during the design of a digital circuit is **testing**.
Before the chip is manufactured, we have to make sure that everything is working
as intended. Consider this: When you ship _software_ to a customer, and he/she
finds a bug, you can easily patch it through a _software update_. However, what
do you do when a customer finds a bug in your chip? How do we fix bugs in chips?
The answer is: we don't, because there is no such thing as a "hardware update"
(some chips actually can be _reconfigured_, but we will cover them in a later
post). Even if we could, doing this for potentially millions of sold chips, is
straight-up infeasible. That's why a LOT of time is put into testing before
production. This is especially important for safety-critical applications such
as planes or medical devices.

There are several ways to test a digital circuit. One method is **simulation**.
In simulation, our HDL design files are read and test signals are applied to see
whether the design behaves as intended. If an error is found during simulation,
the designer analyzes the circuit and fixes the bug. Simulation is just one part
of a whole sub-branch in digital design: **Verification**. Over the decades,
with the rising complexity of chips, a lot of effort has been put into coming up
with efficient verification methods. Simulation, as we saw above, is one of the
more classical methods. Newer methods, such as **formal verification** try to
_mathematically prove_ that a circuit will work as intended.

Why verification is so important is also highlighted by **Spectre** and
**Meltdown**. These were security vulnerabilities found in common processors,
such as those from Intel or AMD. Even such big companies, with decades of
experience, could not entirely verify their chips. And hardware bugs can be
found years after the chips had been shipped. This shows how important
verification becomes with growing chip complexity.

We have seen that EDA tools help designers lift most of the heavyweights in
digital design. And that testing and verification are a big chunk of work in
chip design. Next, let us see how a chip is then actually fabricated!

## How is a chip manufactured?

Once the chip has been designed and verified, it is finally ready for
manufacturing. What we didn't tell you until this point is, out of what
materials chips are made of. Let us answer that for you. A transistor is made
mostly from **semiconductors**, such as Silicon. Only the special properties of
semiconductors allow a transistor to behave like a tiny switch.

<div style="overflow: auto;" markdown="1">

  </figcaption>
</figure>
The entire manufacturing of a chip is a very complex and complicated process
("complex and complicated" is almost an understatement; it is one of the most
sophisticated stuff we humans ever came up with!). The process consists of
several steps. A plain Silicon _wafer_ forms the base (also called _substrate_)
on top of which the actual circuit will be built upon. We will spare you the
details here, but basically, with each step, the transistors and their
connections are more or less "printed" onto the wafer substrate. Because of
their nature of being _integrated_ into a Silicon wafer, chips are also called
**integrated circuits** (IC) - this is contrary to "classical" circuits where
the circuit is made up of _discrete_ elements, such as resistors or capacitors.
</div>

Like the design, also the production of chips has been almost fully automatized.
Because the process is very complex, it is a costly investment for a chip
designer to maintain an own chip factory. Costs for such factories (which are
also called **foundries**, or fabs) can easily go up into the _billions_.
Therefore, a handful of companies in the world have specialized themselves in
manufacturing microchips. A chip design company then just sends their final
design files to one of the foundries for production. The foundry will then
manufacture the chips and send them back to the design house. The manufacturing
usually takes several months.

By the way, having only a few foundries across the world can become a
significant bottleneck in the supply chain when the global demand for chips
suddenly increases. This is also what we can currently (as of writing this
article) observe during the chip shortage due to the Corona pandemic.

CNBC on this topic, if you are interested.

## Wrap-up

Whew. There was a lot to take in probably, right? Let's do a quick wrap-up of
the main ideas we covered in this introductory post on digital design:

- Digital design deals with the design and implementation of **microchips**
- A microchip is a small **electronic circuit**, that is also called
  **integrated circuit**
- The fundamental building block of any microchip is the **transistor**
- A transistor is like a **switch**
- Using multiple transistors, we can construct **logic gates**
- Using multiple logic gates, we can construct **complex circuits**, such as
  processors

And that's it! We hope you now have a better understanding of what goes into the
development of these "black magic" containing black rectangles called
microchips. In our next posts, we will cover the topics touched in this post in
more detail, starting with transistors. Stay tuned!
