In our last two posts, we have learned what logic gates are, which kinds of
gates exist, and how they can be implemented using transistors.

Now it's time to see what we can do with these things! Have you ever wondered
why a computer is called "computer"? Well, as the name suggests, computers
calculate, or _compute_ things. What and how they do it is something we will
cover in the future, but for now, we'll focus on the essentials.

It turns out that we can use logic gates to do all kinds of **mathematical
operations**. In this post, we will have a look at the most basic mathematical
operation: the **addition**. How can we add two numbers using just simple logic
gates, you ask?

Well, for that we need some basic understanding of **binary numbers** and how
addition works in the binary system. As this blog series focuses more on the
hardware side, we assume that you are already familiar with binary numbers. If
not, or you need to refresh your memory, then feel free to consult a search
engine and/or the latest AI of your choice to learn the basics about binary
numbers. We recommend giving the
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) about binary
numbers a read. Of course, there are also plenty of tutorials on YouTube, such
as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpuPe81bc2w) one on the basics of
binary numbers, followed by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5EkxfNEMjE)
one on doing addition in the binary system. We might also cover binary numbers
in a future post in our [Getting Started](/categories/getting_started) category,
so stay tuned for that. Ok, do you know what binary numbers are and how to add
them? Perfect! Then let's see how we can build a circuit that can do binary
addition.

To keep things simple, let's first look at adding two **1-bit** numbers. Recall,
that, if both bits are 0 then the sum is 0, obviously. If one of the bits is 1
and the other is 0, then the sum is 1. And finally, if both bits are 1, then the
sum will be 0 and we get a _carry_ of 1. We can visualize this in a table form
(calling the two bits “A” and “B”, respectively):

| A   | B   | Sum | Carry |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     |

Do you notice something? Right, this looks like a logic gate **truth table**!
And that's precisely how we can come up with a logic circuit for adding two
1-bit numbers. This circuit has two inputs, the two numbers (or bits) A and B,
and two outputs, the sum, and the carry. The corresponding circuit looks as
follows:

  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

This circuit looks pretty simple, just one **XOR** gate whose output is the sum
bit and an **AND** gate where the carry comes out. If you look at the truth
table above, and remember what the truth tables of the AND and XOR gate look
like, you can easily see why we need these two gates. This circuit is called
**Half-Adder**. To not have to redraw all the gates when we are drawing many
half-adders, engineers came up with a new symbol to depict a half-adder:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">

  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

<div class='note-normal' markdown='1'>
This is yet another example of _abstraction_: We simplify things by hiding the
lower-level details of a particular system. In our case, the low-level details
were the AND and XOR gates of the half-adder. And remember, those gates
themselves again were an abstraction of the underlying transistor circuits!
</div>

You might think that now extending it to adding larger than 1-bit numbers is as
simple as taking a bunch of half-adders for each digit, right? Well, almost. We
need to extend our circuit a bit. Why? Because we also need to consider the
_carry_ bit coming from the _previous_ digits (except for the first digits). The
half-adder, as we saw, has no carry input, it only produces a carry output. By
the way, “carry input” is also called “Cin” (spell “see in”) and analogously
“carry output” is called “Cout”. This is useful in circuit diagrams, so we don't
have to write much (remember? Engineers are lazy ;) The extension to the
half-adder is called **Full-Adder** and has an additional carry input. We will
cover the full-adder in the [next post](/categories/digital_design/full_adder).

For the curious ones: Try to draw the transistor diagram of the half-Adder (if
you've read our last posts, then this shouldn't be too hard)! Also, one more
thing: Whenever we hook up a bunch of logic gates together, the resulting
circuits are referred to as _combinational circuits_. In digital design, there
is another important class of circuits, the _sequential circuits_, which we will
see in the future.

For now, we hope you got a basic understanding of how the half-adder works!
Let's summarize what we've learned. The half-adder...:

- ... adds together **two** individual bits
- ... produces a **sum bit** and a **carry bit** as outputs
- ... is constructed using one **AND** gate and one **XOR** gate
