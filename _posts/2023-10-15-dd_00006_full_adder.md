## Key Takeaways of this post:

- The **Full-Adder** (FA) is a _combinational circuit_ which adds three
  **1-bit** numbers
- In addition to the Half-adder, the FA has a third input, the **Carry-In**
  (Cin)
- A FA can be constructed using **two HAs** and an **XOR** gate

[In our previous post](/categories/digital_design/half_adder), we have looked at
the Half-Adder (HA), which is a _combinational circuit_ used to add two 1-bit
binary numbers. In this post, we will take a look at an extension of the
Half-Adder, namely the Full-Adder (FA). The Full-Adder will allow us to
construct larger adders. Let's start with having a look at the FA's circuit
diagram:

As you can see, the FA consists of _two_ Half-Adders. Like the HA, a FA takes in
two bits (A and B). Additionally, there is a third input: the Carry-In (Cin).
And like the HA, the FA produces two output bits, a Sum and a Carry-out (Cout).
In a way, the FA is adding _three_ 1-bit values. The Sum is the same as the sum
output of the HA on the right, and the Cout is the XOR of the carries coming out
of both HAs. The truth table of the FA looks as follows:

|  A  |  B  | Cin |     | Cout | Sum |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | --- | :--: | :-: |
|  0  |  0  |  0  |     |  0   |  0  |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |     |  0   |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |     |  0   |  1  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |     |  1   |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |     |  0   |  1  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |     |  1   |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |     |  1   |  0  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |     |  1   |  1  |

If you pay attention, you can see that the Cout and Sum bits combined represent
the binary sum value of the three input bits: When only one of the input bits is
a “1”, the combined sum is always “01”. When extacly two inputs are “1”, the sum
is 2, or “10” in binary. And when all three input bits are “1”, i.e., the sum is
3, then we see “11” at the output.

Just as with anything we have seen so far, we can _abstract_ away the inner
details of the FA by introducing the following schematic symbol:

  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Note that we have slightly rearranged the inputs (red) and the outputs (blue).
This will become handy when we begin to combine multiple FAs to create larger
adders. In the next post of this series, we will get to know our first adder
circuit, the **Carry-Ripple Adder**. See you then!
