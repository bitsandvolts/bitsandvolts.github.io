Hello and welcome to our next post. We hope you take the great momentum of our
[last post](/categories/getting_started/programming_hello_world) where you were
able to run your first Python program. In this post, you'll learn about Python
Packages and Virtual Environments. Let's get started!

## Python Packages

The beauty of Python and one of the reasons why it is so popular and
beginner-friendly is the huge community. On the one hand, this provides support
in forums if you get stuck. On the other hand, this leads to a huge code base
that you can use.

While implementing your program, you'll face multiple challenges. Imagine you
want to plot some data or you want to solve some mathematical equation. No
matter what, chances are high that someone else has done the exercise before and
most likely there is a **Python package** that you can download and use.

Isn't this cool? We will show a quick example in this post.

## Virtual Environments

One challenge is to keep all packages, that are relevant to your project,
organized. This is what **virtual environments** are for. Let's skip the theory
and directly jump into a concrete example. Typically, you create one virtual
environment (short: venv) per project. For the counter, that we've implemented
in our [previous post](/categories/getting_started/programming_hello_world) we
haven't created a venv yet. So, let's do it now. Here is again the code we
developed in our previous post:

```python
def simple_counter(target):
    count = 1
    while count <= target:
        if count == target:
            print("Finally done! Count is:", count)
        elif count >= target - 2:
            print("Almost there! Count is:", count)
        else:
            print("Stay patient! Count is:", count)
        count += 1

simple_counter(5)
```

You create the venv using:

    $ python -m venv counter_venv

This creates a new venv called counter_venv. Of course, you can choose whatever
name you like. If we want to work with a venv we have to activate it:

    $ source counter_venv/bin/activate

You can check that it works with the following command:

    $ which python
    counter_venv/bin/python

This command returns the path to the used Python binary. In our case, it should
point to a path inside our created environment.

## Pip - Python's Package Manager

Let's take our counter and put some colors on the output. And yes! There is a
package called _rich_ that makes our lives very easy. For installation, we use
Python's package manager **Pip**:

    $ pip install rich

Note that this will install the package only for the activated venv.

## Our Counter with beautiful colors

```python
from rich import print

def simple_counter(target):
    count = 1
    while count <= target:
        if count == target:
            print("[green]Finally done![/green] Count is:", count)
        elif count >= target - 2:
            print("[yellow]Almost there[/yellow]! Count is:", count)
        else:
            print("[red]Stay patient[/red]! Count is:", count)
        count += 1

simple_counter(5)
```

<figure class="img-center" style="width:35%">
  <img src="/assets/images/gs_00011_color_output.png" title="Colored counter" alt="Colored counter">
</figure>

At the beginning of our code, you see a new **import statement**. The _rich_
package defines a _print_ function that we want to use. Inside the _print_, we
simply annotate the desired color. Isn't that easy?

Well ... You might wonder how we know about this package and how to use it. The
answer is a mix of Google, ChatGPT, and documentation. For example, you can find
the documentation of the _rich_ package
[here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html). After some time
you will know the most popular packages.

## Finalize your project

When your project is ready and you want to distribute it to others, you need to
make sure that they install the same packages as you did. This can easily be
done using:

    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt

If you open the file, you'll find the following content:

    markdown-it-py==3.0.0
    mdurl==0.1.2
    Pygments==2.19.1
    rich==14.0.0

At the end, you can spot the _rich_ package including a version tag. This is
important and guarantees that someone else uses the exact same version as you
used for development. But what about the other listed packages? They are
required by the _rich_ package. Pip keeps track of all dependencies
automatically and installs required packages for you. You can check package
information using:

    $ pip show markdown-it-py
    Name: markdown-it-py
    Version: 3.0.0
    Summary: Python port of markdown-it. Markdown parsing, done right!

    License:
    Location: /home/bjoern/projects/hello_world/counter_venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages
    Requires: mdurl
    Required-by: rich

You can see that it is required by the _rich_ package and itself requires
_mdurl_.

Once you have exported your requirements, someone else just needs to install it:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

When you want to leave your venv you can deactivate it using:

    $ deactivate

## Useful Packages

While the most useful Python packages will depend on your specific project, here
are some widely used and popular packages that are definitely worth exploring:

- NumPy – Core library for numerical computing and working with arrays.
- Pandas – Powerful data analysis and manipulation toolkit.
- Requests – Elegant and simple HTTP library for making API calls.
- Matplotlib – 2D plotting library for creating charts and graphs.
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning library for classification, regression,
  clustering, and more.
- BeautifulSoup – HTML and XML parser used for web scraping.
- Pytest – Popular framework for writing and running tests.
- FastAPI – Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.

## Summary

We hope this post helped you understand how to organize Python packages using
virtual environments! Let’s quickly recap what we covered:

- Python has a huge ecosystem of reusable packages you can install and use in
  your projects.
- Virtual environments (venv) help to organize packages for your project
- You learned how to:
  - Create and activate a virtual environment
  - Use pip to install packages like _rich_
  - Use _pip freeze_ to save dependencies to a requirements.txt file
  - Use _pip show_ to inspect package metadata and dependencies
- We also introduced some popular Python packages worth checking out.

At this point, you are ready to start your own project! You can start by picking
one of the listed packages and playing around with it. The internet is full of
awesome projects, so we are sure you will find an idea for your first own
project! Happy coding, and don't forget to follow us on
