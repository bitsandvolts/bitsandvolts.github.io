We from Bits&Volts hope that, despite the current circumstances, you had a nice
transition into ðŸŽ†2022! Let's hope that things get better this year. Whatever
comes, we will keep writing our blog posts, so you always have something to
learn!

Now, let's start this year with the second part of our **Introduction to Logic
Gates** series. [Last time](/categories/digital_design/logic_gates_1), we have
seen what kind of logic gates there are. This time we will learn how these gates
can be built using **transistors**. But before we dive in, let us first show the
solution to last post's challenge. In case you don't fully remember (to be fair,
it's been some time...), this was the circuit for which we asked you to create
its truth table:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:90%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-excercise-labeled.jpg" alt="Excercise" title="Excercise">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

And here is the solution, its truth table (we also added labels for intermediate
values):

| A   | B   | C   | u   | v   | w   | Z   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |

Did you get it right? If not, don't worry, just try again. And in case you are
completely stuck, feel free to use our comment function below, and we can help
you out!

Let's continue with this post!

## CMOS

<!-- Complementary MOS. PMOS, NMOS pairs.

Explain 5V terminal and ground. -->

Before we start, let's get some terminology out of the way. As a reminder, in
our post about [transistors](/categories/digital_design/transistors), we have
seen how the schematic symbols of **NMOS** and **PMOS** transistors look like:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-nmos-pmos.jpg" alt="NMOS PMOS" title="NMOS PMOS">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

As you can see in the picture, the upper parts are each connected to something
called "5V". What does that mean? "V" stands for **Volts**, and as you probably
guessed, it is the unit for **voltage**. In digital circuits, voltages are used
to represent binary (or _logic_) 1s and 0s. Two voltages are sufficient, and
usually, the higher of the two represents a binary 1, and the lower a binary 0.
Common voltages for binary 1s are 5V or 3.3V. In our example above, the drain
(of the NMOS) is connected to 5 Volts. So this circuit uses 5V to represent a
binary 1. What about the triangle thingies at the bottom? This is what we call
**ground**. It is the _reference potential_[^1] and can be viewed effectively as
0V. You probably guessed it: 0V represents a binary 0.

[^1]:
    There are no _absolute_ voltages. A voltage is always a _potential
    difference_. Therefore, every electric circuit needs some kind of reference
    potential, a baseline, and all other voltages are relative to this
    reference. We might do a future post on the basics of electronics where we
    explain in depth what voltage, current, etc are.

An NMOS transistor turns on (i.e. opens its channel) when some voltage larger
than its _threshold_ voltage is applied to its gate. The threshold voltage is
different from transistor to transistor. For the NMOS transistors used in this
post, we assume that 5 Volts are well above their threshold voltage, and
therefore, they turn on. The PMOS transistors behave opposite to NMOS
transistors: they turn on when the gate voltage is 0V, and they turn off when 5V
are applied to their gate. From now on, we will use the binary values for the
gate voltages: 1 means that 5V are applied to the gate, and 0 means 0V.

Most modern chips make use of a technology called **CMOS**. CMOS stands for
_Complementary Metal-oxide semiconductor_. The "MOS" part might be already
familiar to you: this refers to the MOSFETs, we already learned about. The
"complementary" means, that in CMOS circuits, always _pairs_ of NMOS and PMOS
transistors are used. The reasons why pairs of transistors are used are beyond
the scope of this post, but just keep that fact in mind. In the following, we
will see plenty of examples.

## Inverter

The most basic CMOS circuit is the **CMOS inverter** and consists of two
transistors. One PMOS and one NMOS:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmosinv.jpg" alt="CMOS inverter" title="CMOS inverter">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

The input on the left goes into the gates of both transistors. The output on the
right is connected to the middle section between the two transistors. You may
remember from our last post that an inverter just flips a 1 to a 0, and vice
versa. Let's try to see this in the circuit.

First, we look at when the input is a logic 1. Recall that a logic 1 is
represented in the hardware as a voltage, e.g. 5V, and a logic 0 is usually 0V.
Both transistors will see a 1 (5V) at their gates. The NMOS will consequently
open the channel, thus effectively connecting the output to ground (or 0V). So,
the output will be seen as a logic 0 - just like you would expect from an
inverter! But what about the upper PMOS transistor? Well, when a PMOS sees logic
1 at its gate, it will "shut off", i.e. the channel is closed, meaning no
current can flow from the 5V terminal to the output. Therefore, the output is
only influenced by the NMOS, which "pulls down" the output to 0:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:35%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmosinv0path.jpg" alt="CMOS inv 1" title="CMOS inv 1">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

In the other case, namely, when the input is a logic 0, things just work the
opposite way. Now, the NMOS will switch off, thus cutting off the output from
ground. The PMOS will open its channel, and a current can flow from the upper 5V
terminal, through the PMOS, all the way to the output. We say that the PMOS
"pulls up" the output to 5V. An observer at the output pin will see 5V, and thus
a logic 1 - just as you would expect from an inverter.

<figure class="img-center" style="width:35%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmosinv1path.jpg" alt="CMOS inv 0" title="CMOS inv 0">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

We hope this wasn't too confusing. Let's look at some more logic gates.

## NAND gate

The **NAND** gate looks a bit more complicated than the inverter. It has four
transistors: 2 PMOS and 2 NMOS. In the following picture, we also included the
truth table of a NAND gate, in case you don't remember it exactly:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:80%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmos-nand.jpg" alt="CMOS NAND" title="CMOS NAND">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

First, we notice that each input goes to one PMOS and one NMOS at the same time.
If we look closely, we can see a slight difference in the arrangement of the
PMOS and NMOS transistors. The two NMOS transistors are connected in **series**.
This means that there is only _one_ path from ground to the output. On the other
hand, the two PMOS transistors are connected in **parallel**: there are multiple
ways (two in this case) in which current can travel from the 5V terminal to the
output. Ok, so what's the deal with that?

Since the NMOS are in series, _both_ need to be turned on for a current to flow
between ground and output (in other words, to pull down the output to 0). For
the PMOS, to pull up the output to 1, it is sufficient when _at least one_ PMOS
is turned on.

When both inputs A and B are a logic 1, both NMOS transistors will open,
allowing a current to flow between ground and the output. At the same time, both
PMOS transistors will switch off. The output will see a logic 0. This exactly
matches with the last row of the NAND gate's truth table.

In all other cases, i.e. when at least one of the inputs is a logic 0, at least
one NMOS will switch off, thereby breaking the series connection, and no more
current flow between ground and the output will be allowed. On the other hand,
at least one PMOS will open its channel, and a current can flow between the 5V
terminal and the output - the output becomes a logic 1. Again, this matches
precisely with the first three rows of the truth table!

To make it more clear for you, the following picture shows the resulting paths
for each input combination:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:98%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmos-nand-paths.jpg" alt="NAND paths" title="NAND paths">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

## NOR gate

The **NOR** gate looks similar to the NAND gate. But notice that now, the PMOS
transistors are connected in series, while the NMOS are in parallel:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:80%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmos-nor.jpg" alt="CMOS NOR" title="CMOS NOR">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Only in the case when both inputs are a logic 0, both PMOS transistors will
open, and a current can flow from 5V to the output. At the same time, both NMOS
will cut off the connection to ground. Therefore, the output is a logic 1.

In all other cases, when at least one input is 1, at least one PMOS will break
the path from 5V to the output, and at least one NMOS will open the path from
ground to the output. Therefore, the output is a logic 0.

## AND/OR gate

Next, let us look at the how the **AND** gate looks:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:60%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-cmos-and.jpg" alt="CMOS AND" title="CMOS AND">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Do some parts of the circuit look familiar to you? Right! There is a NAND gate,
followed by an inverter! If you remember from our last post, a NAND gate itself
is just an AND gate, followed by an inverter. So, when a NAND gate is then again
followed by an inverter, we again get an AND gate. But why is it done like that?

It has to do with how NMOS and PMOS fundamentally work. However, explaining the
details here is out of the scope of this post. Just note, that in all CMOS
circuits, the PMOS transistors are always in the upper part, namely at the 5V
section, while the NMOS transistors are in the lower part, i.e. near ground. The
PMOS section is often referred to as a **pull-up network** because when there is
a path from the 5V terminal to the output, the output always gets pulled up to
5V as well, as we have seen in the previous examples. Similarly, the NMOS
section is called **pull-down network**, because it pulls down the output to 0V.

Forcing all PMOS transistors into the pull-up network and all NMOS transistors
into the pull-down network, respectively, might sound like a limitation.
However, due to the semiconductor physics of these two types of MOSFETs, it is
indeed the most optimal way to design CMOS circuits.

And that's why an AND gate is constructed using a NAND + Inverter. An AND gate,
therefore, consists of six transistors. If you still don't believe us: try
designing a CMOS AND gate with less than six transistors, and where all PMOS
transistors are in the pull-up network, and all NMOS transistors are in the
pull-down network. (hint: you will successfully fail).

What about the **OR** gate? We leave that task to the reader, it's not that
difficult if you understood how the AND gate is made! (you can also find the
solution in the next section ;)

## Complex circuit

Let's put it all together - quite literally. We will show you how the transistor
schematic of the circuit from last post's challenge looks like. Here is the
circuit again:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:90%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00003-excercise.jpg" alt="Exercise" title="Exercise">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

A little warning: don't be scared, this is the transistor implementation of the
same circuit:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:98%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd-00004-complex.jpg" alt="complex CMOS circuit" title="comlex CMOS circuit">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

To make it easier for you, we have circled the logic gates in different colors.
We can recognize the CMOS transistors of the AND, OR, and NAND gates. The CMOS
XOR we didn't show you earlier, but from the circuit, you can see that it looks
much more complex than the other gates. Overall, this circuit made up of just
four logic gates already consumes 28 individual transistors! Drawing this by
hand is still somewhat manageable. But think of a big processor: those beasts
consist of _millions_ of logic gates (_not_ transistors). And since each gate is
made up of multiple transistors itself, you can imagine, that designing an
entire CPU by hand is straight up infeasible nowadays! That's why we have to use
the help of **Electronic Design Automation** (EDA), i.e. software to automate
the design of digital circuits, when we build such complex chips. These tools
will do the mapping from logic gates to transistors fully automatic! If you are
interested, we can do a post about EDA, what tools there are and how they work;
let us know in the comments (we might do it anyway ;)

## Physical Layout

One final note. Remember when we said in our last post, that the symbols we use
for drawing logic gates were not how the actual gate would look in hardware?
Well, even the transistor diagrams we showed you in this post don't depict how
the real hardware looks, but they are already pretty close! In case you are
wondering, here is how a NAND looks on the final chip:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:30%">

  <figcaption class="text-center">

</figure>

"This looks nothing like the schematics you showed us in this post!?", you may
ask yourself. That is a valid question! Let us explain what's going on here. If
you have read our very [first post](/categories/digital_design/intro) in the
Digital Design series, you may remember that there are a lot of steps involved
when making a microchip. One of these steps is **physical design**, which comes
shortly before manufacturing the chip. In this step, the circuit design
consisting of thousands or millions of logic gates is transformed into a
so-called **layout**. The layout describes how the individual transistors and
the wires connecting them should be _laid out_ on the final chip[^2]. The layout
is the final _blueprint_ for the manufacturing. We have to admit that the
picture above does not show a real photo[^3] of a NAND gate. However, the
structures are in fact how they would look on the final chip, though without any
colors.

[^2]:
    Additionally, physical aspects like size and power consumption are
    considered.

[^3]:
    Taking a photo of nm-sized gates using a conventional camera is not
    possible, as visible light has a much bigger wavelength compared to modern
    gates sizes! However, we can use a _scanning electron microscope_ instead.
    Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxv3JoS1uY8) if you
    are interested.

Physical design in itself is so complex, that there are engineers who just work
on optimizing the layout of a chip. Nowadays, with the advent of sophisticated
EDA tools, this task is being automated more and more. However, a lot of
research and manual handwork still goes into optimizing the physical layout of
_individual_ gates, to make them even smaller and faster. That's why the NAND
gate layout above doesn't look at all like the schematic at first glance.
However, the layout was simply optimized in such a way to consume the least
amount of area (chip area = more money you have to pay the foundry), but the
fundamental transistors and their connections are still there, so the layout it
still implementing the NAND gate's schematic.

## Summary

If this post was too much information to take in, don't worry. In this blog
series, we will focus on higher-level digital design, and the lowest we will
ever go to is the level of basic logic gates. With this post, we just wanted to
show you how the gates are implemented in hardware, so you can at least say _"I
have seen how logic gates are implemented on a chip"_, and that already would
make us happy :)

As we now have reached the end of this post, let us quickly summarize the key
ideas we have learned:

- **CMOS** stands for "Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor"
- In CMOS there are always **PMOS / NMOS** pairs
- The PMOS transistors are part of the **pull-up network**, and the NMOS
  transistors belong to the **pull-down network**
- The CMOS **inverter** consists of one PMOS and one NMOS transistor
- The CMOS **NAND** and **NOR** gates consist of two PMOS and two NMOS
  transistors
- We have learned about **series** and **parallel** connections
- An **AND** gate is built using a NAND gate followed by an inverter
  - Similar for the **OR** gate: NOR followed by an inverter
- We have learned what a **physical layout** is, and, as an example, have seen
  how a NAND gate looks in the layout
