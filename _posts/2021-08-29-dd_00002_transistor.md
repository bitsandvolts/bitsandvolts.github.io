In our [last post](/categories/digital_design/intro), we introduced you to what
goes into the making of **microchips**. If you haven't read that post yet, feel
free to read it first, then come back to this post again. In this post, we will
cover the basics of the fundamental building block of any chip out there: the
**transistor**.

As we already briefly touched in our previous post, a transistor is nothing but
an electrically controlled **switch**. The fact that their switching behavior
can be controlled electrically, makes them very fast compared to mechanical
switches, such as the light switch in your room. And, additionally, transistors
can be made _extremely_ tiny in size, making it possible to fit _billions_ of
them on a single, fingernail-sized microchip! How do they work, you ask? Well,
let's find out!

## A Transistor is a Faucet for Electrons

Let us approach this by using the best way of explaining complex things:
**analogies**! The basic concept of transistors can be explained with a **water
analogy**. You can think of a transistor as a water faucet (essentially a faucet
is also nothing but a _switch_ for water), as shown in the following picture. In
the picture, the faucet is closed (or "off"):

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-faucet-closed.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

When we open the faucet, water is allowed to pass through and exit at the end of
the faucet:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-faucet-open.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

This is the "on" state of the faucet.

A transistor works just like our faucet example. Of course, there is no water in
electric circuits. The flow that we are controlling with a transistor is the
flow of electrons, or in other words, the **electric current**.

The following picture shows the _schematic_ symbol of a transistor (we use this
symbol to represent transistors in electric circuit diagrams):

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-mosfet-schematic.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

A transistor is a three-terminal device, i.e., it has three pins that we can
connect other wires/devices to. The terminals are called the **gate**,
**source**, and **drain**. Current can flow from source to drain through the
part called "channel". The gate contact can control this current: if there is no
voltage present at the gate, the channel is closed, and no current flows; the
transistor is _off_. When we apply a certain voltage at the gate terminal, the
channel opens, and a current can flow from source to drain; the transistor is
_on_.

Now, let's see how transistors and pipes are related:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-faucet-mosfet.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

The water flows from the "source" to the "drain" through the "channel". The
"gate", in this case, is simply the valve of the faucet.

Here you have it: A transistor is basically a tiny faucet to control the flow of
electrons! Unlike a real faucet, which can be opened in one quarter, one half,
and so on, we operate transistors in only two _states_[^1]: ON or OFF. Because
engineers are lazy, we like to abbreviate the states with 1 and 0, respectively.
And this is precisely the reason why computers "think" in 1s and 0s (also called
_binary_)! We will uncover the secrets of how this thinking actually works in
our upcoming posts.

todo:

- halb offen gibts auch bei transistoren ✔
- nicht jeder transistor wird über eine spannung gesteuert

[todo] Just for completeness: there are also transistors that use a current flow
instead of a voltage to control

-->

Next, let us have a look at a concrete type of transistor.

[^1]:
    Actually, transistors can also be "half-open". However, this operating mode
    is out of interest in _digital_ systems. If you are curious: transistors
    operated in states between "fully off" and "fully on" are commonly found in
    _analog_ circuits, such as amplifiers.

## The MOSFET

There are two types of transistors out there. One is the **field-effect
transistor**, or FET, and the other one is the **bipolar transistor**. Both
types have the same goal, namely to control the flow of some current. However,
even though both are semiconductor devices, they work based on different
principles. This makes each of them useful in special application areas. As
nowadays in digital microchips solely FETs are used, we will focus our
discussion on them for now.

Let's look at the most basic FET: the **MOSFET**. Its name stands for
_metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor_. The next picture shows a
cross-section of a MOSFET:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-mosfet-cross-section.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

You might have noticed the same three terminals (gate, source, and drain) we
introduced earlier, this time with their common abbreviations (G, S, D), as they
are used by engineers. "B" stands for **bulk** (sometimes also called _body_ or
_substrate_). The bulk is basically the basis on top of which the transistor is
built (if you remember from the previous post this basis is nothing but the
actual _wafer_). Bulk, source, and drain are made from **silicon**. The gate on
the top can theoretically be made of any metal, usually, poly-silicon is used
today. Between the gate "plate" and the rest of the transistor, we can see
another layer called **oxide**. The role of this oxide layer is to be an
_insulating_ layer so that no current can flow between the gate and the bulk (or
source/drain).

When we apply a voltage at the gate terminal, a conducting **channel** starts to
form between the source and the drain. This channel then allows electrons to
flow from source to drain. The voltage we need to apply to the gate such that
the channel opens and a current can flow between source and drain, has a special
name: **threshold voltage**. For any gate voltage below the threshold voltage,
the transistor will not let any current pass from source to drain. The threshold
voltage is commonly abbreviated as $V_{th}$.

Let's see what goes on inside a transistor.

When there is no voltage present at the gate, the channel between source and
drain is not conductive, i.e., no current can flow from source to drain. The
MOSFET is switched _off_. The following picture depicts this state (notice how
the electrons are waiting at the source terminal):

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-mosfet-channel-off.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

When we now start applying a _positive_ voltage at the gate terminal, the gate
will attract **electrons** from the source terminal (remember that the source is
made from Silicon which has some free electrons). As we increase the gate
voltage, more and more electrons from the source will _accumulate_ near the gate
(the area where the channel is supposed to be). Note that the electrons actually
would love to get to the positively charged gate, but they can't because of the
insulating oxide layer between gate and bulk. When the gate voltage reaches the
_threshold voltage_, there are now enough electrons in the channel area to allow
a current flow between source and drain. Imagine the accumulated electrons in
the channel as a "bridge" between source and drain. Now electrons can flow from
source to drain; the MOSFET is switched _on_:

<figure class="img-center" style="width:50%">
  <img src="/assets/images/dd_00002-mosfet-channel-on.png" alt="">
  <!-- <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Microchips</figcaption> -->
</figure>

Don't worry if all that sounded too complicated. It was to us too, when we
learned this the first time! As we will point out later in this post, it is not
necessary to remember all the nitty-gritty details (even we do not).

One more thing. There are two types of MOSFETs. The one we presented you above
is also referred to as **NMOS**. The other MOSFET type is called **PMOS**. The
difference between the two is that the PMOS has the opposite behavior of an
NMOS: when there is _no_ gate voltage, the PMOS is switched on, and a positive
gate voltage switches off the PMOS. We will spare you further details here[^2],
but for now, it's sufficient to know that there are these two types of MOSFETs,
and they essentially work opposite to each other. In digital systems, we need
both NMOS and PMOS to build complex circuits.

We hope that by now, you have a broad understanding of how transistors work. If
you want to see a more visual explanation and maybe also understand the more
low-level details of how MOSFETs work (e.g., why we have to "dope" Silicon to
enhance its conductivity), check out this great
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY) by Veritasium. Another good
explanatory video with animations is
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfvyj88Hs_o) one.

It shall be noted that even though it is helpful (and sometimes necessary) to
understand the detailed working of transistors, in many practical situations,
especially when designing digital circuits, it is often enough to just know that
transistors can be in two states, _on_ or _off_. This is one example of an
**abstraction**, where we basically ignore the low-level details and just focus
on the essentials. We will find many of these abstractions throughout digital
design.

Next, we'll conclude this post with a short wrap-up!

[^2]:
    For the curious ones: it has to do with the so-called _majority charge
    carriers_. In NMOS devices, these are the electrons (as we saw earlier), and
    in PMOS devices the majority carriers are positively charged _holes_ (have a
    look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY) by
    Veritasium, he explains nicely what holes are).

## Wrap-up

Let's summarize what we've learned in this post.

- A transistor is an electronic device to **control the flow of current**.
- There are two major types of transistors: **bipolar** and **field-effect**
  transistors.
- In **digital** circuits, field-effect transistors, such as the **MOSFET** are
  used.
- MOSFET stands for **metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor**.
- A MOSFET has three terminals: **gate**, **source**, and **drain**.
- A **voltage** at the gate can control current flow between source and drain.
- There are two types of MOSFETS: **NMOS** and **PMOS**.
- In digital circuits, transistors are used as **switches**.
- A transistor switch can be off or on, hence modern computers only "understand"
  **binary** (0/1).

In our next posts, we will learn how transistors can be used to design complex
digital circuits! And, as always, we will keep you updated on
