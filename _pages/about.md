## Bits&Volts - A blog for everyone

There are already tons of good resources available. So you are probably
wondering why we are starting another blog. Back when we were fresh students, we
always felt that the barrier to enter the field of electronics is way higher
than it should've been. Even at university, we learned deep and complex theory,
while simple and practical aspects were rarely explained. So many times we did
things wrong or inefficiently while a voice in our head asked: "Why didn't
anyone tell us?". It can be hard to get going with electronics since you do not
know the right place to start. How can you distinguish between a good and a bad
resource? Often we come across resources that either do only cover a small piece
of the whole pie or skip important details, making it too hard to follow.

We created Bits&Volts to explain exciting topics in detail from the very
beginning so that everyone can follow. For more advanced topics, we try to
supplement required prior knowledge with references to other posts or external
resources. Whether you are an absolute beginner, an enthusiastic hobbyist, a
passionate student, or even an experienced engineer, our blog is for everyone.

To begin with, we introduce two categories: **Getting Started** and **Digital
Design**. In the former, we will share the knowledge that is useful to enter the
fields of electronics and computer engineering as well as fundamentals for other
blog categories. The latter is about digital design where we will explain the
fundamentals of building digital circuits. We will start with the basics such as
transistors and logic gates, then move up towards higher-level concepts, like
processors.

In the future, we might add more categories, but for now, we will start with the
upper two. So, let's see where it takes us!

## Who we are

We are Bjoern and Kirthihan, two enthusiastic computer engineers with a passion
for embedded systems, digital design and efficient software programming. Our
journey started with studying Electrical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University
in Germany. At the Institute for Communication Technologies and Embedded
Systems, we worked as student assistants, where we contributed to different
projects in the fields of hardware accelerators for machine learning, FPGA
design, processor prototyping and embedded software. Nowadays, Bjoern works as a
firmware developer in the audio industry. Kirthihan works as a digital hardware
developer in the cybersecurity industry.
